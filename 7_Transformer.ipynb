    "# Build a self-attention Transformer model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will build the Transformer model for the classification task. The main architecture of the Transformer is derived from the paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf, but to be able to perform text classification we have to re-build the model a bit by applying the Max or Avg Pooling according to https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.02364.pdf, where instead of using hidden representations we will us the last Transfomer block output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Transformer is solely based on the self-attention mechanism, disposing recurrent units or convolution layers at all, thanks to which that architecture is superior in terms of the prediction quality and the training time. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and keeps also the ability of discerning long-term dependencies. To increase the generalization performance of the model we will use the label smoothing method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is going to be trained on the clean_review column from the training dataset. In the end, the model will be evaluated on the test set to determine the generalization error.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will perform the hyperparameter fine-tuning and visualize model's learning curves to compare the model's performance while working on different set of parameters. "

    "#### Self-attention\n",
    "\n",
    "Attention is a function that maps the lineary transformed input sequence represented as three vectors - the query, the key and the value to the output vector. The output is calculated as a weighted sum of the values, where the weights are computed using compatibility function of queries and keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to create the three aforementioned vectors by multiplying the embedding vector of each word (including positional encoding or embedding) by three weight matrices that are learned during training. The second dimension of these matrices can be of an arbitrary shape, this enables us to use query, key and value vectors with different dimensionality than the input embedding vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><center>\n",
    "$q_{i} = W_{q} \\cdot x_{i} \\quad k_{i} = W_{k} \\cdot x_{i} \\quad v_{i} = W_{v} \\cdot x_{i}$\n",
    "</center></p>\n",
    "Where $x_{i}$ is the embedding vector and $W_{q}, W_{k}, W_{v}$ are the queries, keys and values weight matrices respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next the score is obtained by using the alignment function (dot product). The score is calculated between a query vector that corresponds to the word for which we would like to compute the output and all the key vectors. To prevent softmax from taking as an input to high values that might cause the gradient vanishing problem we have to scale the dot product by dividing it by the square root of the lenght of the query/key vector. \n",
    "<p><center>\n",
    "$score = \\frac{q_{i}^T \\cdot\\: k_{j}}{\\sqrt{k_{dim}}}$\n",
    "</center></p>\n",
    "Where $k_{dim}$ is the key (query) vector dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then all the scores are run through the softmax layer that makes that all of them are in the range from 0 through 1 and ensures that they add up to 1. Softmaxed score at given position is then multiply by the corresponding value vector. Next all the resulted vectors are summed up to produce the context vector that contains the information about how much attention to pay to each of the input words to predict the output at given position."

    "\n",
    "Multi-Head Attention is a mechanism introduced by https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf that takes into consideration the fact that different words can have a different meaning to their adjacent words, which improves the model's ability to focus on a different part of an input sequence. Instead of performing single attention that sums all information together, which may cause that two similar sentences will have the same meaning for the model (what should not happen), we conduct self-attention operation *h* times in parallel, while each head (single attention) has its own different, randomly initialized weight matrices $W_{q}, W_{k}, W_{v}$. The resulted context vectors of each attention head are concatenated and multiplied by the additional weight matrix during linear transformation to the lower dimensional space.\n",

    "\n",
    "The model's layers presented up to this time don't take into account the order of the words, they don't treat inputs as a sequence, but rather as a set, thus if we shuffle words in an input sequence we will obtain the same classification. To introduce into the model the possibility of including the order of words in its predictions, it is necessary to add the positional encoding or positional embedding layer to the architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this implementation we will use the positional encoding that has the edge over the embedding, namely, it uses a function that maps words positions to vectors, thus it can be used also to encode words positions in sequences that are longer than those seen during training thanks to the extrapolation possibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sine and cosine functions can be used to encode words positions (use *sin* for even dimensions and *cos* for odd dimensions):\n",
